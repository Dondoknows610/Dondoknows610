# Ethical Hacking Labs üë®üèø‚Äçüíª üíª

Welcome to the collection of my **Ethical Hacking** hands-on labs! This repository showcases various techniques and methods in ethical hacking, including SQL Injection, XML Injections, and XSS Attacks.

## Labs Overview

### 1. [SQL Injection üíâ Lab](./SQL-Injection-Lab.md)
This lab demonstrates the power of **SQL Injection** and how attackers can exploit web application vulnerabilities. We use Kali Linux and OWASP DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) to simulate an attack and learn the basics of SQL Injection techniques.

### 2. [XML Injections üìú Lab](./XML-Injection-Lab.md)
In this lab, we explore the vulnerabilities introduced by improperly configured XML parsers. Learn how attackers can manipulate XML data to carry out injection attacks and gain unauthorized access to data.

### 3. [XSS Attacks (Cross-Site Scripting) ‚ö†Ô∏è Lab](./XSS-Attack-Lab.md)
This lab dives into **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, where we learn how attackers can inject malicious scripts into web applications, potentially stealing sensitive data or executing harmful actions on a victim's browser.

## Tools Used

The following tools and platforms were used across the labs:
- **Kali Linux** - A Linux distribution designed for penetration testing.
- **OWASP DVWA** - A vulnerable web application used for security testing.
- **VirtualBox** - A platform for creating and managing virtual machines.
- **Burp Suite** - A security testing tool used to find vulnerabilities in web applications.
- **Hydra** - A fast and flexible brute-force password cracking tool.
